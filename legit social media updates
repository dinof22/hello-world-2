So for my assignment of doing 30 commits i am going to write about each time someone post something on facebook that they actually write that is their original words and not a repost of some stupid cat video. i feel like nobody posts about anything they do them selves anymore. so i guess i will mention each time someone actually does something interesting in their life. Of course people will remain anonymous and their stories generalised.

alright so for the first post someone posted about their daughter who is coming home from her mission in 2 months. See now THAT is a perfectly good thing to post on social media. i had to scroll through like 20 posts of "Now This" video reposts to get to it though... gosh i hate those things...
