So for my assignment of doing 30 commits i am going to write about each time someone post something on facebook that they actually write that is their original words and not a repost of some stupid cat video. i feel like nobody posts about anything they do them selves anymore. so i guess i will mention each time someone actually does something interesting in their life. Of course people will remain anonymous and their stories generalised.
