# hello-world-2
this is a hello world Repo for my 3D modelling class
My name is Jake Lofgren and I am required to tell you something about myself. ugh... just kidding Id love to talk about myself. I am actually currently an IT major, but I at one point I wanted to do animation. I changed my mind, but currently I'm deciding to try it out again. I still you love to do animation as a career, so I am just going to see if I can get into the animation program at UVU, and if i can great. But if not I think I will still be a happy person in the Cybersecurity field (which is also awesome). I just don't want to miss out on a future I may have in digital media if I never gave it a shot. And who knows, maybe I am meant to be an Animator! Thats always been my dream!
